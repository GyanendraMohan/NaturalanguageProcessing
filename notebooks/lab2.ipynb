Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda.

Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.",

You can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to Williams' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. A masterful production about one of the great master's of comedy and his life. <br /><br />The realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solid then disappears.

This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.",

Croyez-moi, ce n’est pas un spectacle pour les timides ou les timides. Son émission ne fait aucun bruit en matière de drogue, de sexe ou de violence. Il s'agit de matériel, dans l'usage classique du mot.<br /><br />Il s'appelle ainsi car c'est le surnom donné au pénitencier d'État à sécurité maximale de Scald. Il s'est concentré principalement sur Emerald City, une section expérimentale de la prison où toutes les cellules ont des façades en verre et sont tournées vers l'intérieur, de sorte que la vie privée n'est pas une priorité. Am City abrite de nombreuses personnes. Organes, musulmans, gangstas, nations, chrétiens, italiens, irlandais et plus encore. Les reniflements, les regards mortels, les transactions potelées et les accords louches ne sont jamais loin. Oubliez les jolis tableaux peints pour le grand public, oubliez le charme, oubliez la romance... ou ne plaisantez pas. Le premier épisode que j'ai vu m'a semblé tellement méchant qu'il était surrey, je ne pouvais pas dire que j'étais prêt pour cela, mais au fur et à mesure que je le regardais, j'ai développé un goût pour Z et je me suis habitué aux niveaux élevés de violence graphique. Pas seulement la violence, mais l'injustice (des gardes véreux qui seront vendus pour une pièce de cinq cents, des détenus qui tueront sur ordre et s'en tireront sans problème, des détenus de la classe moyenne transformés en bouleaux de prison en raison de leur manque de compétences dans la rue ou d'expérience en prison) observation Z, vous pouvez vous sentir à l'aise avec ce qui est inconfortable à voir... que si vous pouvez entrer en contact avec votre côté le plus sombre.\n"
